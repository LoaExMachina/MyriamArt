Born in Port-au-Prince, Myriam Pitte's life is a neverending journey. France is where she's lived the longest, where she married, had children, and started exposing her paintings. Her first exposition was in l'Espace Beaurepaire in Paris, but more followed in Normandie, Brittany and Vend√©e, in Rome; and more recently in Massachussets, where she is now based. Using abstract art, she explores such themes as pain, healing, identity and the dynamics between the individual, society and the universe.
